            Today, the vast majority of Mexicans speak Spanish, the country's
            official language. The original languages survive, but are in danger
            of disappearing. At least 68 languages spoken in the country date
            back to pre-Mexican times, but only 6% of people understand and
            speak them. The language spoken by the Aztecs is called Nahuatl.
            Learning Nahuatl has become a way of showing pride in one's origins.
