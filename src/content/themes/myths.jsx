      The Aztec way of counting time was based on two parallel calendars, one of
      365 days and one of 260 days. Once every 52 years, these two calendars
      matched up. This marked a new “century,” with big religious celebrations.
      The ceremony had great significance for the society and symbolized
      rebirth. People got rid of their possessions and idols. At the start of
      the festival, all fires in the city were extinguished. At midnight on the
      last day, when the fire star reached the zenith of the night sky, a
      prisoner was killed as a gift for rebirth. The priest then lit a new fire
      that would once again illuminate the city. When the fire was extinguished,
      the people could be sure that the sun would continue to rise over the next
      52 years. It was a time of rebirth. This ceremony was celebrated for the
      last time by the Aztecs in 1508.

          <i>Danza de los Voladores</i>, or the Dance of the Flyers, is an old
          ceremony that is today chiefly performed in the state of Veracruz. The
          original aim of the tradition was to ensure good harvests. The ritual
          consists of five dancers climbing up a 30-meter (98.4-ft) pole, from
          which four of the dancers then hang and spin from ropes. In the
          beginning, the pole was a tree. The fifth person remains on top of the
          pole, playing a flute and drums. The dancers spin around the pole 13
          times each, for a total of 52 times – an important number in
          Mesoamerican calendars. The dancers symbolize the four directions and
          the four elements: earth, air, fire and water. The person remaining on
          top of the pole represents the fifth sun. The ritual is recognized by
          UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage, a tradition to be
          protected.

      The Sun Stone (<i>Piedra del Sol</i>) is the Aztecs’ most famous work of
      art. It was made over 500 years ago and tells the story of the four worlds
      that existed before the current fifth world. The sun god Tonatiuh, in the
      center of the stone, is very important. He gave his life to become the sun
      and for humans to be created. The four earlier worlds each had their own
      god who ruled over them. These were Chalchiuhtlicue, the goddess of rivers
      and lakes, the wind god Quetzalcoatl, the fire god Xiuhtecutli, and the
      fertility goddess Xochiquetzal. When their worlds collapsed, it was
      because of the dangerous sides of the four elements, such as floods,
      hurricanes, fires and drought.

      When the fifth and last world was to be created, the gods gathered in the
      city of Tenochtitlán to decide who would sacrifice themselves. The old
      fire god Huehuetéotl lit a sacrificial bonfire. It was finally the poor
      and humble god Nanahuatzin who sacrificed himself and jumped into the
      fire. He became the new sun.

      To create new life, something had to be sacrificed. Though gifts, the
      people paid the gods back for the suffering they went through to create
      the universe. These sacrifices took place in both the temple and in the
      home. Valuable objects, animals, incense, flowers and food were common
      gifts. Prayers, songs and dance were also dedicated to the gods. People
      also gave their own blood, by cutting themselves, and sometimes people
      were even killed. It was believed that human sacrifices would prolong

            Aztec art often depicted faces with one half of the face living and
            the other half a skull. This shows that life and death are connected
            and neither of them can exist without the other. The notion of
            duality existed throughout Mesoamerica and was a cornerstone of
            religious thought. Other important opposites were day and night, and

            The Aztecs had a number of myths about how the world was created.
            They were inspired by creation myths from other Mesoamerican
            cultures. The Aztecs thought that the world had been created and
            destroyed in several cycles. According to one of their myths, the
            world was in its fifth cycle when the Spaniards came and conquered
            Mesoamerica in the 16th century. Each world was controlled by
            different gods using the four elements: earth, water, wind or fire.
            The gods had the ability to both destroy and create a new world.
            Each world was called a sun, and for a new sun to be formed, at
            least one god must sacrifice him- or herself. The belief that
            something must be sacrificed for something new to be born is a
            cornerstone of Aztec faith.

              After independence in 1821, Mexico went through a difficult, long
              and bloody process. A state with its own institutions, principles
              and laws had to be designed. Mexico also needed to strengthen its
              territorial borders, which were threatened by two foreign powers,
              the US (1846–48) and the French (1863–1867). During this process,
              the country also experienced internal bloody conflicts and civil
              war between proponents of conservative versus liberal principles
              and values. In these conflicts, the Catholic Church took the
              conservative side. The Church got involved in projects to
              establish a Mexican empire led by a prince from Austria, under the
              protection of Napoleon III of France. Even before the liberals’
              victory over the conservatives and their imperial project, the
              Catholic Church had already seen its material assets shrink due to
              the nationalization of the Church’s land by the liberal
              government. The nationalization also affected the collective
              landholdings of the indigenous peoples. The victory against the
              French intervention in 1867 secured the secular state of Mexico.
              The Catholic Church was no longer allowed to interfere in politics
              or other government activities. These experiences distinguish
              Mexico from the rest of Latin America, where the Catholic Church
              maintained some of its political power throughout the 20th
              century.

              In January 1994, the Zapatistas led an uprising in the state of

              two weeks, with demands for equality, justice and democracy for
              all of Mexico. The Zapatistas’ revolutionary movement began in the

              people. The 1994 uprising was not the first in Chiapas but, with
              the help of the Internet, the event received a lot of
              international attention. The Zapatistas have created their own
              society, with their own schools, cooperatives, hospitals, courts,
              etc. The Zapatista dolls document this historical event. The first
