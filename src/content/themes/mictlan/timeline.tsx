      According to the Aztecs, there were several realms of the dead. The way
      someone died determined where they ended up. Warriors who died in battle
      or women who died in childbirth were considered to have died a noble death
      and they went to one of the highest realms. Those who died of natural
      causes and old age were transferred to the underworld and the Mictlan
      realm of the dead.

      Mictlan was ruled by Mictlantecuhtli, the god of death. He was the most
      powerful death deity and originally came from Toltec mythology. The
      goddess of death, Mictlancihuatl, also ruled here. Even today, she is
      considered to be responsible for memorial ceremonies for the dead,
      including the celebration of <i>Día de Muertos.</i>

      The journey to the Mictlan realm of the dead took several years and was
      filled with hardships. The dead were guided on their journey by the
      hairless dog <i>Xoloitzcuintle</i>, called Xolo. During the journey
      through the underworld, the dead were threatened by both monsters and
      difficult terrain. One of the obstacles was a deep river that the dog
      carried the dead person over. arrived.

      To create new life, something had to be sacrificed. Though gifts, the
      people paid the gods back for the suffering they went through to create
      the universe. These sacrifices took place in both the temple and in the
      home. Valuable objects, animals, incense, flowers and food were common
      gifts. Prayers, songs and dance were also dedicated to the gods. People
      also gave their own blood, by cutting themselves, and sometimes people
      were even killed. It was believed that human sacrifices would prolong
      life.

      The Spaniards probably exaggerated how many people the Aztecs sacrificed.

      The Aztec way of counting time was based on two parallel calendars, one of
      365 days and one of 260 days. Once every 52 years, these two calendars
      matched up. This marked a new “century,” with big religious celebrations.
      The ceremony had great significance for the society and symbolized
      rebirth. People got rid of their possessions and idols. At the start of
      the festival, all fires in the city were extinguished. At midnight on the
      last day, when the fire star reached the zenith of the night sky, a
      prisoner was killed as a gift for rebirth. The priest then lit a new fire
      that would once again illuminate the city. When the fire was extinguished,
      the people could be sure that the sun would continue to rise over the next
      52 years. It was a time of rebirth. This ceremony was celebrated for the
      last time by the Aztecs in 1508.

      The Sun Stone (<i>Piedra del Sol</i>) is the Aztecs’ most famous work of
      art, often reproduced on posters and souvenirs. It was made over 500 years
      ago and tells the story of the four worlds that had existed before the
      then ongoing fifth world. The sun god <i>Tonatiuh</i>, in the center of
      the stone, is very important. He gave his life to become the sun and for
      humans to be created. The four earlier worlds each had their own god who
      ruled over them. These were <i>Chalchiuhtlicue</i>, the goddess of rivers
      and lakes, the wind god <i>Quetzalcoatl</i>, the fire god{' '}
      <i>Xiuhtecutli</i>, and the rain god <i>Tlaloc</i>. When their worlds
      collapsed, it was because of the dangerous sides of the four elements,
      such as floods, hurricanes, fires and drought.

      When the fifth and last world was to be created, the gods gathered in the
      city of Teotihuacán to decide who would sacrifice themselves. The old fire
      god <i>Huehuetéotl</i> lit a sacrificial bonfire. It was finally the poor
      and humble god <i>Nanahuatzin</i> who sacrificed himself and jumped into
      the fire. He became the new sun.
