      When the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés landed on the Yucatan
      Peninsula in 1519, there was already a powerful empire there. For nearly
      200 years, the Aztec Empire had been developing into a superpower, with
      several million inhabitants. There were also other societies there, and
      the Aztecs forced them to pay taxes and took people as prisoners.
    </span>,
    <span key="1">
      It took two years, and one of the deadliest conflicts in history, for the
      Spaniards to take power and finally proclaim the colony of Mexico in 1521.
      It was not a struggle between two peoples, but instead a prolonged process
      of both violence and negotiation between several parties. Cortés relied on
      support from the groups that had long been oppressed by the Aztecs. Even
      when the last Aztec ruler, Moctezuma, was killed, the battle was still not
      won. The fact that the Spaniards were eventually able to take power is
      largely due to the deadly diseases they brought with them, which
      overpowered the Aztecs’ resistance and killed a majority of the indigenous
      population.

      Malinche was sold into slavery when she was a little girl. In 1519, she
      was given as a gift to the Spaniards, who had just arrived in what we now
      call Mexico. Because she spoke several languages, she became their
      interpreter. The conquistador Hernán Cortés needed the support of various
      ethnic groups to overthrow the ruling Aztecs. He is said to have promised
      Malinche “more than freedom” if she helped him, and she soon proved to be
      a skilled diplomat. When she discovered the Aztecs’ plan to defeat the
      Spaniards, she acted quickly. The Spaniards escaped and it was the
      beginning of the end for the Aztec Empire. Malinche and Cortés
      collaborated for a long time and even had a child together.

      La Malinche can be viewed as a traitor, and this has led to the emergence
      of the term <i>Malinchismo</i>, used for someone who prefers the foreign
      over the Mexican. But she has also been described as an intelligent
      individual in the center of a historically decisive event. Yet regardless
      of how she is viewed, she is still one of the most significant women in
      Mexico’s history. La Malinche is portrayed in several dances, including
      <i>Danza de la Pluma</i> and <i>Danza de Malinche</i>.

      Spain’s colonization not only included Mexico and Central America, but
      also parts of what is today the United States. Eight states, including
      California, New Mexico and Arizona, once belonged to what came to be
      called “New Spain.” It was ruled for nearly 300 years by a Spanish viceroy
      located in Mexico City.

      Later, during the Mexican–American War (1846–1848), these states were lost
      to the US and Mexico’s landholdings decreased by more than half. The Rio
      Grande River marked the new border, which still exists today between Texas
      and Mexico. The border has become increasingly severe over the years. Many
      people try every day to flee from Mexico to the US. An escape that
      involves a lot of risks and in the worst case, death.

      Masks are an old and important tradition in Mexico. Masks had been made
      for thousands of years before the Spanish came. After the conquest, the
      Spanish used masks as a way to spread their religion, Catholicism. Later,
      the colonial governments tried to ban masks and dances, without success.
      After Mexico’s independence, mask-making has continued to develop and now
      shows a mixture of Mexican history and elements of popular culture.
    </span>,
    <span key="1">
      Most of the masks here have been used in <i>Danza de los Santiagueros</i>,
      a dance that tells the story of the Spanish Catholics’ victory over the
      Moors in Spain in the 15th century. The main character is Santiago the
      Apostle. In Mexico, the dance was introduced by missionaries to evoke fear
      and respect and to show that Christianity always wins. Today, 200 years
      later, the dance has taken on a new meaning. It now chiefly symbolizes the
      important corn crop, and the struggle against the July and August heat
      waves. Festivals dedicated to Santiago are held on July 25th throughout
      Mexico.

      <i>Danza de la Pluma</i> , the Dance of the Feather, is a play performed
      in May every year telling the story of the Spanish conquest. The tradition
      is different in different places in Mexico, but the main characters are
      always the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés and the Aztecs’ last ruler,
      Moctezuma II. La Malinche, Cortés’s interpreter, also has an important
      role.

      The dance is important for many of the Zapotec indigenous people. It shows
      the resilience and perseverance of the Zapotec against the attempt to
      erase their culture. Some of the dance performances show the time before
      the Spanish conquest as an ideal. The dance can therefore be seen as a way
      to try to strengthen the Zapotec identity. And an inspiration to keep
      holding on to one’s origins.

      The Madonna image <i>La Virgen Guadalupe</i> is, for many people, a symbol
      of the birth of the nation of Mexico. The image is said to have originated
      from a revelation a man had in 1531 on a hill near Mexico City. The man
      was Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin, a member of the indigenous Chichimeca
      culture and a devout Christian. He met a girl, a vision of the Virgin
      Mary, who spoke his language, Nahuatl. She asked him to build a church in
      her honor. Images of this dark-skinned young woman have been used to unite
      Mexico, because she represents both Christianity and origin. She is
      sometimes called the first Mexican.

      Every year in December, thousands of people make a pilgrimage to the
      Basilica of Guadalupe, which was built on Tepeyac Hill. It is one of the
      most-visited Catholic pilgrimage destinations in the world. Nobel Laureate
      Octavio Paz once wrote that “the Mexican people, after more than two
      centuries of experiments and defeats, have faith only in the Virgin of
      Guadalupe and the National Lottery.”

            The artist Frida Kahlo often addressed death in her art. In this
