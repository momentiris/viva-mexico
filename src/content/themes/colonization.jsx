            To colonize means to take power over an area. The Spanish
            colonization of North and Central America was a violent story of
            upheaval, with huge consequences. The country of Mexico arose
            through this power struggle, with turbulence and tragedy as a
            result. Communities were shattered and a large portion of the
            indigenous population died.

            People had lived here for thousands of years, in large societies and
            cultures. Wars and struggles had taken place between them, and the
            cultures influenced one another. The indigenous religions were
            suppressed by the Spaniards but could not be wiped out completely.
            The traditions proved resilient. They continued to change and mix
            with the Spanish. And are still changing.

              When the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés landed on the Yucatan
              Peninsula in 1519, there was already a powerful empire there. For
              nearly 200 years, the Aztec Empire had been developing into a
              superpower, with several million inhabitants. There were also
              other societies there, and the Aztecs forced them to pay taxes and
              took people as prisoners.

            <p key="1">
              It took two years, and one of the deadliest conflicts in history,
              for the Spaniards to take power and finally proclaim the colony of
              Mexico in 1521. It was not a struggle between two peoples, but
              instead a prolonged process of both violence and negotiation
              between several parties. Cortés relied on support from the groups
              that had long been oppressed by the Aztecs. Even when the last
              Aztec ruler, Moctezuma, was killed, the battle was still not won.
              The fact that the Spaniards were eventually able to take power is
              largely due to the deadly diseases they brought with them, which
              overpowered the Aztecs’ resistance and killed a majority of the
              indigenous population.

              Malinche was sold into slavery when she was a little girl. In
              1519, she was given as a gift to the Spaniards, who had just
              arrived in what we now call Mexico. Because she spoke several
              languages, she became their interpreter. The conquistador Hernán
              Cortés needed the support of various ethnic groups to overthrow
              the ruling Aztecs. He is said to have promised Malinche “more than
              freedom” if she helped him, and she soon proved to be a skilled
              diplomat. When she discovered the Aztecs’ plan to defeat the
              Spaniards, she acted quickly. The Spaniards escaped and it was the
              beginning of the end for the Aztec Empire. Malinche and Cortés
              worked together for a long time and even had a child together.

              La Malinche can be viewed as a traitor, something that has led to
              the emergence of the term <i>Malinchismo</i>, which is used for

              been described as an intelligent individual in the center of a

              she is still one of the most significant women in Mexico’s

              Spain’s colonization not only included Mexico and Central America,

              what came to be called “New Spain.” It was ruled for nearly 300

              Masks are an old and important tradition in Mexico. Masks had been
              made for thousands of years before the Spanish came. After the
              conquest, the Spanish used masks as a way to spread their
              religion, Catholicism. Later, the colonial governments tried to
              ban masks and dances, without success. After Mexico’s
              independence, mask-making has continued to develop and now shows a
              mixture of Mexican history and elements of popular culture.

              the Spanish Catholics’ victory over the Moors in Spain in the 15th
              century. The main character is Santiago the Apostle. In Mexico,
              the dance was introduced by missionaries to evoke fear and respect
              and to show that Christianity always wins. Today, 200 years later,
              the dance has taken on a new meaning. It now chiefly symbolizes
              the important corn crop, and the struggle against the July and
              August heat waves. Festivals dedicated to Santiago are held on
              July 25th throughout Mexico.

              <i>Danza de la Pluma</i>, the Dance of the Feather, is a play

              Mexico, but the main characters are always the Spanish
              conquistador Hernán Cortés and the Aztecs’ last ruler, Moctezuma

              The dance is important for many of the Zapotec indigenous people.
              It shows the resilience and perseverance of the Zapotec against

              show the time before the Spanish conquest as an ideal. The dance
              can therefore be seen as a way to try to strengthen the Zapotec
              identity. And an inspiration to keep holding on to one’s origins.

              The <i>La Virgen Guadalupe</i> Madonna is, for many people, a
              symbol of the birth of the nation of Mexico as a result of the
              Spanish colonization. The image is said to have originated from a
              revelation a priest had in 1531 on a hill near Mexico City. The
              priest was named Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin and he was a member of
              the indigenous Chichimeca culture. He met a girl, a vision of the
              Virgin Mary, who spoke his language, Nahuatl. She asked him to
              build a church in her honor. Images of this dark-skinned young
              woman have been used to unite Mexico, because she represents both
              Christianity and origin. She is sometimes called the first
